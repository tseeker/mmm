MMM - the Mediocre Minecraft Mod
=================================

This is a mod I'm making for my kid and myself.

As the name implies, it's mediocre. Half the time I have no idea what
I'm doing, and I'm terrible at graphics. In addition, this is a completely
random assortment of stuff. Finally, it probably won't play nice with other
mods, because 1/ I can't be bothered and 2/ I'm not interested. So there.

Stuff that's in the mod:
* Workbench (crafting table + book + chest), because I'm lazy
* Various new stones (limestone, chalk, slate, basalt)
* Various new ores (native copper, cuprite, malachite, cassiterite,
sphalerite, native silver, bauxite, galena, cinnabar, sulfur, saltpeter)
* Various new metals (copper, tin, zinc - the rest isn't done yet)
* Alloys (brass, bronze, steel) made using an alloy furnace (which can also
make coke because I haven't added a coke furnace yet)
* Tomato plants + weird, glowing, carnivorous plants in the Nether
* Quite a few food recipes
* Hevea and bamboo
* A few new biomes
* Various decorative blocks
